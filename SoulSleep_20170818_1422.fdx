And standing behind him are Pastor Collier in the b-boy stance, Pastor Cain is throwing up the “Westside” sign, and Pastor Resureccion is sporting a tall flat-top that is blond at the top -- ala Kid from Kid and Play.</Text>

      <Text>In ancient times errant spirits, or what some people call ‘demons’ walked among men, conquering humans and feeding on them.

A little over two-thousand years ago, something happened to wipe out all of these entities overnight.

The human servants of the Errant Ones gained favor with their masters, and obtained great wealth and power for their loyalty.

They sought out twelve men said to be responsible for the event that had banished their masters.

They found them all and brutally tortured and executed them.

Fast forward more than two-thousand years into the future, and now the Errant Ones are returning.
